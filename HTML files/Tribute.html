					<p style="font-size:18px;">Stephen William Hawking was born on 8th
					Jan 1942 (exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo) in Oxford, England. His parents'
					house was in north London but during the second world war Oxford was considered a safer place
					to have babies. When he was eight his family moved to St. Albans, a town about 20 miles north
					of London. At the age of eleven, Stephen went to St. Albans School and then on to University
					College, Oxford (1952); his father's old college. Stephen wanted to study mathematics although
					his father would have preferred medicine. Mathematics was not available at University College,
					so he pursued physics instead. After three years and not very much work, he was awarded a
					first class honours degree in natural science.</p>


					<p style="font-size:18px;">Stephen Hawking worked on the basic
						laws which govern the universe. With Roger Penrose he showed that Einstein's general theory of
					relativity implied space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black
					holes (1970). These results indicated that it was necessary to unify general relativity with
					quantum theory, the other great scientific development of the first half of the 20th century.
					One consequence of such a unification that he discovered was that black holes should not be
					completely black, but rather should emit 'Hawking' radiation and eventually evaporate and
					disappear. Another conjecture is that the universe has no edge or boundary in imaginary
					time. This would imply that the way the universe began was completely determined by the laws
					of science. Towards the end of his life, Stephen was working with colleagues on a possible
					resolution to the black hole information paradox, where debate centres around the conservation
					of information.His many publications included The Large Scale Structure
					of Spacetime with G F R Ellis, General Relativity: An Einstein Centenary Survey, with W
					Israel, and 300 Years of Gravitation, with W Israel. </p>
					<br><br>

					<p style="font-size:18px;">Among the popular books Stephen Hawking
					published are his best seller A Brief History of Time, Black Holes and Baby Universes and
					Other Essays, The Universe in a Nutshell, The Grand Design and My Brief History. In 1963 Stephen was diagnosed with ALS, a form of
					Motor Neurone Disease, shortly after his 21st birthday. In spite of being wheelchair-bound and
					dependent on a computerised voice system for communication Stephen continued to combine family
					life (he has three children and three grandchildren) with his research into theoretical
					physics, in addition to an extensive programme of travel and public lectures. Thanks to the
					Zero-G Corporation, he experienced weightlessness in 2007 and always hoped to make it into
					space one day.</p>
